    "description": "Implement the myAtoi(string s) function, which converts a string to a 32-bit signed integer (similar to C/C++'s atoi function).\n\nThe algorithm for myAtoi(string s) is as follows:\n\n\n\tRead in and ignore any leading whitespace.\n\tCheck if the next character (if not already at the end of the string) is '-' or '+'. Read this character in if it is either. This determines if the final result is negative or positive respectively. Assume the result is positive if neither is present.\n\tRead in next the characters until the next non-digit character or the end of the input is reached. The rest of the string is ignored.\n\tConvert these digits into an integer (i.e. \"123\" -> 123, \"0032\" -> 32). If no digits were read, then the integer is 0. Change the sign as necessary (from step 2).\n\tIf the integer is out of the 32-bit signed integer range [-231, 231 - 1], then clamp the integer so that it remains in the range. Specifically, integers less than -231 should be clamped to -231, and integers greater than 231 - 1 should be clamped to 231 - 1.\n\tReturn the integer as the final result.\n\n\nNote:\n\n\n\tOnly the space character ' ' is considered a whitespace character.\n\tDo not ignore any characters other than the leading whitespace or the rest of the string after the digits.\n\n\n \nExample 1:\n\nInput: s = \"42\"\nOutput: 42\nExplanation: The underlined characters are what is read in, the caret is the current reader position.\nStep 1: \"42\" (no characters read because there is no leading whitespace)\n         ^\nStep 2: \"42\" (no characters read because there is neither a '-' nor '+')\n         ^\nStep 3: \"42\" (\"42\" is read in)\n           ^\nThe parsed integer is 42.\nSince 42 is in the range [-231, 231 - 1], the final result is 42.\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: s = \"   -42\"\nOutput: -42\nExplanation:\nStep 1: \"   -42\" (leading whitespace is read and ignored)\n            ^\nStep 2: \"   -42\" ('-' is read, so the result should be negative)\n             ^\nStep 3: \"   -42\" (\"42\" is read in)\n               ^\nThe parsed integer is -42.\nSince -42 is in the range [-231, 231 - 1], the final result is -42.\n\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput: s = \"4193 with words\"\nOutput: 4193\nExplanation:\nStep 1: \"4193 with words\" (no characters read because there is no leading whitespace)\n         ^\nStep 2: \"4193 with words\" (no characters read because there is neither a '-' nor '+')\n         ^\nStep 3: \"4193 with words\" (\"4193\" is read in; reading stops because the next character is a non-digit)\n             ^\nThe parsed integer is 4193.\nSince 4193 is in the range [-231, 231 - 1], the final result is 4193.\n\n\n \nConstraints:\n\n\n\t0 <= s.length <= 200\n\ts consists of English letters (lower-case and upper-case), digits (0-9), ' ', '+', '-', and '.'.\n\n"

For example, the first node with val == 1, the second node with val == 2, and so on. The graph is represented in the test case using an adjacency list.\n\nAn adjacency list is a collection of unordered lists used to represent a finite graph. Each list describes the set of neighbors of a node in the graph.\n\nThe given node will always be the first node with val = 1.

If the two linked lists have no intersection at all, return null.\n\nFor example, the following two linked lists begin to intersect at node c1:\n\nThe test cases are generated such that there are no cycles anywhere in the entire linked structure.\n\nNote that the linked lists must retain their original structure after the function returns.\n\nCustom Judge:\n\nThe inputs to the judge are given as follows (your program is not given these inputs):\n\n\n\tintersectVal - The value of the node where the intersection occurs. This is 0 if there is no intersected node.\n\tlistA - The first linked list.\n\tlistB - The second linked list.\n\tskipA - The number of nodes to skip ahead in listA (starting from the head) to get to the intersected node.\n\tskipB - The number of nodes to skip ahead in listB (starting from the head) to get to the intersected node.\n\n\nThe judge will then create the linked structure based on these inputs and pass the two heads, headA and headB to your program. If you correctly return the intersected node, then your solution will be accepted.\n\n \nExample 1:\n\nInput: intersectVal = 8, listA = [4,1,8,4,5], listB = [5,6,1,8,4,5], skipA = 2, skipB = 3\nOutput: Intersected at '8'\nExplanation: The intersected node's value is 8 (note that this must not be 0 if the two lists intersect).\nFrom the head of A, it reads as [4,1,8,4,5]. From the head of B, it reads as [5,6,1,8,4,5]. There are 2 nodes before the intersected node in A; There are 3 nodes before the intersected node in B.\n- Note that the intersected node's value is not 1 because the nodes with value 1 in A and B (2nd node in A and 3rd node in B) are different node references. In other words, they point to two different locations in memory, while the nodes with value 8 in A and B (3rd node in A and 4th node in B) point to the same location in memory.\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: intersectVal = 2, listA = [1,9,1,2,4], listB = [3,2,4], skipA = 3, skipB = 1\nOutput: Intersected at '2'\nExplanation: The intersected node's value is 2 (note that this must not be 0 if the two lists intersect).\nFrom the head of A, it reads as [1,9,1,2,4]. From the head of B, it reads as [3,2,4]. There are 3 nodes before the intersected node in A; There are 1 node before the intersected node in B.\n\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput: intersectVal = 0, listA = [2,6,4], listB = [1,5], skipA = 3, skipB = 2\nOutput: No intersection\nExplanation: From the head of A, it reads as [2,6,4]. From the head of B, it reads as [1,5]. Since the two lists do not intersect, intersectVal must be 0, while skipA and skipB can be arbitrary values.\nExplanation: The two lists do not intersect, so return null.\n\n\n \nConstraints:\n\n\n\tThe number of nodes of listA is in the m.\n\tThe number of nodes of listB is in the n.\n\t1 <= m, n <= 3 * 104\n\t1 <= Node.val <= 105\n\t0 <= skipA < m\n\t0 <= skipB < n\n\tintersectVal is 0 if listA and listB do not intersect.\n\tintersectVal == listA[skipA] == listB[skipB] if listA and listB intersect.\n\n\n \nFollow up: Could you write a solution that runs in O(m + n) time and use only O(1) memory?"

Each cell interacts with its eight neighbors (horizontal, vertical, diagonal) using the following four rules (taken from the above Wikipedia article):\n\n\n\tAny live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies as if caused by under-population.\n\tAny live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.\n\tAny live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by over-population.\n\tAny dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.\n\n\nThe next state is created by applying the above rules simultaneously to every cell in the current state, where births and deaths occur simultaneously. Given the current state of the m x n grid board, return the next state.\n\n \nExample 1:\n\nInput: board = [[0,1,0],[0,0,1],[1,1,1],[0,0,0]]\nOutput: [[0,0,0],[1,0,1],[0,1,1],[0,1,0]]\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: board = [[1,1],[1,0]]\nOutput: [[1,1],[1,1]]\n\n\n \nConstraints:\n\n\n\tm == board.length\n\tn == board[i].length\n\t1 <= m, n <= 25\n\tboard[i][j] is 0 or 1.\n\n\n \nFollow up:\n\n\n\tCould you solve it in-place?

    "description": "Given a n * n matrix grid of 0's and 1's only. We want to represent grid with a Quad-Tree.\n\nReturn the root of the Quad-Tree representing grid.\n\nA Quad-Tree is a tree data structure in which each internal node has exactly four children. Besides, each node has two attributes:\n\n\n\tval: True if the node represents a grid of 1's or False if the node represents a grid of 0's. Notice that you can assign the val to True or False when isLeaf is False, and both are accepted in the answer.\n\tisLeaf: True if the node is a leaf node on the tree or False if the node has four children.\n\n\nclass Node {\n    public boolean val;\n    public boolean isLeaf;\n    public Node topLeft;\n    public Node topRight;\n    public Node bottomLeft;\n    public Node bottomRight;\n}\n\nWe can construct a Quad-Tree from a two-dimensional area using the following steps:\n\n\n\tIf the current grid has the same value (i.e all 1's or all 0's) set isLeaf True and set val to the value of the grid and set the four children to Null and stop.\n\tIf the current grid has different values, set isLeaf to False and set val to any value and divide the current grid into four sub-grids as shown in the photo.\n\tRecurse for each of the children with the proper sub-grid.\n\n\nIf you want to know more about the Quad-Tree, you can refer to the wiki.\n\nQuad-Tree format:\n\nYou don't need to read this section for solving the problem. This is only if you want to understand the output format here. The output represents the serialized format of a Quad-Tree using level order traversal, where null signifies a path terminator where no node exists below.\n\nIt is very similar to the serialization of the binary tree. The only difference is that the node is represented as a list [isLeaf, val].\n\nIf the value of isLeaf or val is True we represent it as 1 in the list [isLeaf, val] and if the value of isLeaf or val is False we represent it as 0.\n\n \nExample 1:\n\nInput: grid = [[0,1],[1,0]]\nOutput: [[0,1],[1,0],[1,1],[1,1],[1,0]]\nExplanation: The explanation of this example is shown below:\nNotice that 0 represents False and 1 represents True in the photo representing the Quad-Tree.\n\n\n\nExample 2:\n\n\n\nInput: grid = [[1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0],[1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0],[1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1],[1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1],[1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0],[1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0],[1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0],[1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0]]\nOutput: [[0,1],[1,1],[0,1],[1,1],[1,0],null,null,null,null,[1,0],[1,0],[1,1],[1,1]]\nExplanation: All values in the grid are not the same. We divide the grid into four sub-grids.\nThe topLeft, bottomLeft and bottomRight each has the same value.\nThe topRight have different values so we divide it into 4 sub-grids where each has the same value.\nExplanation is shown in the photo below:\n\n\n\n \nConstraints:\n\n\n\tn == grid.length == grid[i].length\n\tn == 2x where 0 <= x <= 6\n\n"

Otherwise, returns -1.\n\tvoid put(int key, int value) Update the value of the key if present, or inserts the key if not already present. When the cache reaches its capacity, it should invalidate and remove the least frequently used key before inserting a new item. For this problem, when there is a tie (i.e., two or more keys with the same frequency), the least recently used key would be invalidated.\n\n\nTo determine the least frequently used key, a use counter is maintained for each key in the cache. The key with the smallest use counter is the least frequently used key.\n\nWhen a key is first inserted into the cache, its use counter is set to 1 (due to the put operation). The use counter for a key in the cache is incremented either a get or put operation is called on it.\n\nThe functions get and put must each run in O(1) average time complexity.\n\n \nExample 1:\n\nInput\n[\"LFUCache\", \"put\", \"put\", \"get\", \"put\", \"get\", \"get\", \"put\", \"get\", \"get\", \"get\"]\n[[2], [1, 1], [2, 2], [1], [3, 3], [2], [3], [4, 4], [1], [3], [4]]\nOutput\n[null, null, null, 1, null, -1, 3, null, -1, 3, 4]\n\nExplanation\n// cnt(x) = the use counter for key x\n// cache=[] will show the last used order for tiebreakers (leftmost element is  most recent)\nLFUCache lfu = new LFUCache(2);\nlfu.put(1, 1);   // cache=[1,_], cnt(1)=1\nlfu.put(2, 2);   // cache=[2,1], cnt(2)=1, cnt(1)=1\nlfu.get(1);      // return 1\n                 // cache=[1,2], cnt(2)=1, cnt(1)=2\nlfu.put(3, 3);   // 2 is the LFU key because cnt(2)=1 is the smallest, invalidate 2.\n                 // cache=[3,1], cnt(3)=1, cnt(1)=2\nlfu.get(2);      // return -1 (not found)\nlfu.get(3);      // return 3\n                 // cache=[3,1], cnt(3)=2, cnt(1)=2\nlfu.put(4, 4);   // Both 1 and 3 have the same cnt, but 1 is LRU, invalidate 1.\n                 // cache=[4,3], cnt(4)=1, cnt(3)=2\nlfu.get(1);      // return -1 (not found)\nlfu.get(3);      // return 3\n                 // cache=[3,4], cnt(4)=1, cnt(3)=3\nlfu.get(4);      // return 4\n                 // cache=[4,3], cnt(4)=2, cnt(3)=3\n\n\n \nConstraints:\n\n\n\t1 <= capacity <= 104\n\t0 <= key <= 105\n\t0 <= value <= 109\n\tAt most 2 * 105 calls will be made to get and put.\n\n\n \n "

It is guaranteed that the given shortUrl was encoded by the same object.\n\n\n \nExample 1:\n\nInput: url = \"https://leetcode.com/problems/design-tinyurl\"\nOutput: \"https://leetcode.com/problems/design-tinyurl\"\n\nExplanation:\nSolution obj = new Solution();\nstring tiny = obj.encode(url); // returns the encoded tiny url.\nstring ans = obj.decode(tiny); // returns the original url after decoding it.\n\n\n \nConstraints:\n\n\n\t1 <= url.length <= 104\n\turl is guranteed to be a valid URL.\n\n"

    "description": "A Binary Matrix is a matrix in which all the elements are either 0 or 1.\n\nGiven quadTree1 and quadTree2. quadTree1 represents a n * n binary matrix and quadTree2 represents another n * n binary matrix.\n\nReturn a Quad-Tree representing the n * n binary matrix which is the result of logical bitwise OR of the two binary matrixes represented by quadTree1 and quadTree2.\n\nNotice that you can assign the value of a node to True or False when isLeaf is False, and both are accepted in the answer.\n\nA Quad-Tree is a tree data structure in which each internal node has exactly four children. Besides, each node has two attributes:\n\n\n\tval: True if the node represents a grid of 1's or False if the node represents a grid of 0's.\n\tisLeaf: True if the node is leaf node on the tree or False if the node has the four children.\n\n\nclass Node {\n    public boolean val;\n    public boolean isLeaf;\n    public Node topLeft;\n    public Node topRight;\n    public Node bottomLeft;\n    public Node bottomRight;\n}\n\nWe can construct a Quad-Tree from a two-dimensional area using the following steps:\n\n\n\tIf the current grid has the same value (i.e all 1's or all 0's) set isLeaf True and set val to the value of the grid and set the four children to Null and stop.\n\tIf the current grid has different values, set isLeaf to False and set val to any value and divide the current grid into four sub-grids as shown in the photo.\n\tRecurse for each of the children with the proper sub-grid.\n\n\nIf you want to know more about the Quad-Tree, you can refer to the wiki.\n\nQuad-Tree format:\n\nThe input/output represents the serialized format of a Quad-Tree using level order traversal, where null signifies a path terminator where no node exists below.\n\nIt is very similar to the serialization of the binary tree. The only difference is that the node is represented as a list [isLeaf, val].\n\nIf the value of isLeaf or val is True we represent it as 1 in the list [isLeaf, val] and if the value of isLeaf or val is False we represent it as 0.\n\n \nExample 1:\n \nInput: quadTree1 = [[0,1],[1,1],[1,1],[1,0],[1,0]]\n, quadTree2 = [[0,1],[1,1],[0,1],[1,1],[1,0],null,null,null,null,[1,0],[1,0],[1,1],[1,1]]\nOutput: [[0,0],[1,1],[1,1],[1,1],[1,0]]\nExplanation: quadTree1 and quadTree2 are shown above. You can see the binary matrix which is represented by each Quad-Tree.\nIf we apply logical bitwise OR on the two binary matrices we get the binary matrix below which is represented by the result Quad-Tree.\nNotice that the binary matrices shown are only for illustration, you don't have to construct the binary matrix to get the result tree.\n\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: quadTree1 = [[1,0]], quadTree2 = [[1,0]]\nOutput: [[1,0]]\nExplanation: Each tree represents a binary matrix of size 1*1. Each matrix contains only zero.\nThe resulting matrix is of size 1*1 with also zero.\n\n\n \nConstraints:\n\n\n\tquadTree1 and quadTree2 are both valid Quad-Trees each representing a n * n grid.\n\tn == 2x where 0 <= x <= 9.\n\n"

Among them, <TAG_NAME> is the start tag, and </TAG_NAME> is the end tag. The TAG_NAME in start and end tags should be the same. A closed tag is valid if and only if the TAG_NAME and TAG_CONTENT are valid.\n\tA valid TAG_NAME only contain upper-case letters, and has length in range [1,9]. Otherwise, the TAG_NAME is invalid.\n\tA valid TAG_CONTENT may contain other valid closed tags, cdata and any characters (see note1) EXCEPT unmatched <, unmatched start and end tag, and unmatched or closed tags with invalid TAG_NAME. Otherwise, the TAG_CONTENT is invalid.\n\tA start tag is unmatched if no end tag exists with the same TAG_NAME, and vice versa. However, you also need to consider the issue of unbalanced when tags are nested.\n\tA < is unmatched if you cannot find a subsequent >. And when you find a < or </, all the subsequent characters until the next > should be parsed as TAG_NAME (not necessarily valid).\n\tThe cdata has the following format : <![CDATA[CDATA_CONTENT]]>. The range of CDATA_CONTENT is defined as the characters between <![CDATA[ and the first subsequent ]]>.\n\tCDATA_CONTENT may contain any characters. The function of cdata is to forbid the validator to parse CDATA_CONTENT, so even it has some characters that can be parsed as tag (no matter valid or invalid), you should treat it as regular characters.\n\n\n \nExample 1:\n\nInput: code = \"<DIV>This is the first line <![CDATA[<div>]]></DIV>\"\nOutput: true\nExplanation: \nThe code is wrapped in a closed tag : <DIV> and </DIV>. \nThe TAG_NAME is valid, the TAG_CONTENT consists of some characters and cdata. \nAlthough CDATA_CONTENT has an unmatched start tag with invalid TAG_NAME, it should be considered as plain text, not parsed as a tag.\nSo TAG_CONTENT is valid, and then the code is valid. Thus return true.\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: code = \"<DIV>>>  ![cdata[]] <![CDATA[<div>]>]]>]]>>]</DIV>\"\nOutput: true\nExplanation:\nWe first separate the code into : start_tag|tag_content|end_tag.\nstart_tag -> \"<DIV>\"\nend_tag -> \"</DIV>\"\ntag_content could also be separated into : text1|cdata|text2.\ntext1 -> \">>  ![cdata[]] \"\ncdata -> \"<![CDATA[<div>]>]]>\", where the CDATA_CONTENT is \"<div>]>\"\ntext2 -> \"]]>>]\"\nThe reason why start_tag is NOT \"<DIV>>>\" is because of the rule 6.\nThe reason why cdata is NOT \"<![CDATA[<div>]>]]>]]>\" is because of the rule 7.\n\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput: code = \"<A>  <B> </A>   </B>\"\nOutput: false\nExplanation: Unbalanced. If \"<A>\" is closed, then \"<B>\" must be unmatched, and vice versa.\n\n\n \nConstraints:\n\n\n\t1 <= code.length <= 500\n\tcode consists of English letters, digits, '<', '>', '/', '!', '[', ']', '.', and ' '.\n\n"

    "description": "Given the root node of a binary tree, your task is to create a string representation of the tree following a specific set of formatting rules. The representation should be based on a preorder traversal of the binary tree and must adhere to the following guidelines:\n\n\n\t\n\tNode Representation: Each node in the tree should be represented by its integer value.\n\t\n\t\n\tParentheses for Children: If a node has at least one child (either left or right), its children should be represented inside parentheses. Specifically:\n\n\t\n\t\tIf a node has a left child, the value of the left child should be enclosed in parentheses immediately following the node's value.\n\t\tIf a node has a right child, the value of the right child should also be enclosed in parentheses. The parentheses for the right child should follow those of the left child.\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\tOmitting Empty Parentheses: Any empty parentheses pairs (i.e., ()) should be omitted from the final string representation of the tree, with one specific exception: when a node has a right child but no left child. In such cases, you must include an empty pair of parentheses to indicate the absence of the left child. This ensures that the one-to-one mapping between the string representation and the original binary tree structure is maintained.\n\n\tIn summary, empty parentheses pairs should be omitted when a node has only a left child or no children. However, when a node has a right child but no left child, an empty pair of parentheses must precede the representation of the right child to reflect the tree's structure accurately.\n\t\n\n\n \nExample 1:\n\nInput: root = [1,2,3,4]\nOutput: \"1(2(4))(3)\"\nExplanation: Originally, it needs to be \"1(2(4)())(3()())\", but you need to omit all the empty parenthesis pairs. And it will be \"1(2(4))(3)\".\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: root = [1,2,3,null,4]\nOutput: \"1(2()(4))(3)\"\nExplanation: Almost the same as the first example, except the () after 2 is necessary to indicate the absence of a left child for 2 and the presence of a right child.\n\n\n \nConstraints:\n\n\n\tThe number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 104].\n\t-1000 <= Node.val <= 1000\n\n"

In a normal queue, once the queue becomes full, we cannot insert the next element even if there is a space in front of the queue. But using the circular queue, we can use the space to store new values.\n\nImplement the MyCircularQueue class:\n\n\n\tMyCircularQueue(k) Initializes the object with the size of the queue to be k.\n\tint Front() Gets the front item from the queue. If the queue is empty, return -1.\n\tint Rear() Gets the last item from the queue. If the queue is empty, return -1.\n\tboolean enQueue(int value) Inserts an element into the circular queue.

    "description": "On a single-threaded CPU, we execute a program containing n functions. Each function has a unique ID between 0 and n-1.\n\nFunction calls are stored in a call stack: when a function call starts, its ID is pushed onto the stack, and when a function call ends, its ID is popped off the stack. The function whose ID is at the top of the stack is the current function being executed. Each time a function starts or ends, we write a log with the ID, whether it started or ended, and the timestamp.\n\nYou are given a list logs, where logs[i] represents the ith log message formatted as a string \"{function_id}:{\"start\" | \"end\"}:{timestamp}\". For example, \"0:start:3\" means a function call with function ID 0 started at the beginning of timestamp 3, and \"1:end:2\" means a function call with function ID 1 ended at the end of timestamp 2. Note that a function can be called multiple times, possibly recursively.\n\nA function's exclusive time is the sum of execution times for all function calls in the program. For example, if a function is called twice, one call executing for 2 time units and another call executing for 1 time unit, the exclusive time is 2 + 1 = 3.\n\nReturn the exclusive time of each function in an array, where the value at the ith index represents the exclusive time for the function with ID i.\n\n \nExample 1:\n\nInput: n = 2, logs = [\"0:start:0\",\"1:start:2\",\"1:end:5\",\"0:end:6\"]\nOutput: [3,4]\nExplanation:\nFunction 0 starts at the beginning of time 0, then it executes 2 for units of time and reaches the end of time 1.\nFunction 1 starts at the beginning of time 2, executes for 4 units of time, and ends at the end of time 5.\nFunction 0 resumes execution at the beginning of time 6 and executes for 1 unit of time.\nSo function 0 spends 2 + 1 = 3 units of total time executing, and function 1 spends 4 units of total time executing.\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: n = 1, logs = [\"0:start:0\",\"0:start:2\",\"0:end:5\",\"0:start:6\",\"0:end:6\",\"0:end:7\"]\nOutput: [8]\nExplanation:\nFunction 0 starts at the beginning of time 0, executes for 2 units of time, and recursively calls itself.\nFunction 0 (recursive call) starts at the beginning of time 2 and executes for 4 units of time.\nFunction 0 (initial call) resumes execution then immediately calls itself again.\nFunction 0 (2nd recursive call) starts at the beginning of time 6 and executes for 1 unit of time.\nFunction 0 (initial call) resumes execution at the beginning of time 7 and executes for 1 unit of time.\nSo function 0 spends 2 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 8 units of total time executing.\n\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput: n = 2, logs = [\"0:start:0\",\"0:start:2\",\"0:end:5\",\"1:start:6\",\"1:end:6\",\"0:end:7\"]\nOutput: [7,1]\nExplanation:\nFunction 0 starts at the beginning of time 0, executes for 2 units of time, and recursively calls itself.\nFunction 0 (recursive call) starts at the beginning of time 2 and executes for 4 units of time.\nFunction 0 (initial call) resumes execution then immediately calls function 1.\nFunction 1 starts at the beginning of time 6, executes 1 unit of time, and ends at the end of time 6.\nFunction 0 resumes execution at the beginning of time 6 and executes for 2 units of time.\nSo function 0 spends 2 + 4 + 1 = 7 units of total time executing, and function 1 spends 1 unit of total time executing.\n\n\n \nConstraints:\n\n\n\t1 <= n <= 100\n\t1 <= logs.length <= 500\n\t0 <= function_id < n\n\t0 <= timestamp <= 109\n\tNo two start events will happen at the same timestamp.\n\tNo two end events will happen at the same timestamp.\n\tEach function has an \"end\" log for each \"start\" log.\n\n"

    "description": "Given a C++ program, remove comments from it. The program source is an array of strings source where source[i] is the ith line of the source code. This represents the result of splitting the original source code string by the newline character '\\n'.\n\nIn C++, there are two types of comments, line comments, and block comments.\n\n\n\tThe string \"//\" denotes a line comment, which represents that it and the rest of the characters to the right of it in the same line should be ignored.\n\tThe string \"/*\" denotes a block comment, which represents that all characters until the next (non-overlapping) occurrence of \"*/\" should be ignored. (Here, occurrences happen in reading order: line by line from left to right.) To be clear, the string \"/*/\" does not yet end the block comment, as the ending would be overlapping the beginning.\n\n\nThe first effective comment takes precedence over others.\n\n\n\tFor example, if the string \"//\" occurs in a block comment, it is ignored.\n\tSimilarly, if the string \"/*\" occurs in a line or block comment, it is also ignored.\n\n\nIf a certain line of code is empty after removing comments, you must not output that line: each string in the answer list will be non-empty.\n\nThere will be no control characters, single quote, or double quote characters.\n\n\n\tFor example, source = \"string s = \"/* Not a comment. */\";\" will not be a test case.\n\n\nAlso, nothing else such as defines or macros will interfere with the comments.\n\nIt is guaranteed that every open block comment will eventually be closed, so \"/*\" outside of a line or block comment always starts a new comment.\n\nFinally, implicit newline characters can be deleted by block comments. Please see the examples below for details.\n\nAfter removing the comments from the source code, return the source code in the same format.\n\n \nExample 1:\n\nInput: source = [\"/*Test program */\", \"int main()\", \"{ \", \"  // variable declaration \", \"int a, b, c;\", \"/* This is a test\", \"   multiline  \", \"   comment for \", \"   testing */\", \"a = b + c;\", \"}\"]\nOutput: [\"int main()\",\"{ \",\"  \",\"int a, b, c;\",\"a = b + c;\",\"}\"]\nExplanation: The line by line code is visualized as below:\n/*Test program */\nint main()\n{ \n  // variable declaration \nint a, b, c;\n/* This is a test\n   multiline  \n   comment for \n   testing */\na = b + c;\n}\nThe string /* denotes a block comment, including line 1 and lines 6-9. The string // denotes line 4 as comments.\nThe line by line output code is visualized as below:\nint main()\n{ \n  \nint a, b, c;\na = b + c;\n}\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: source = [\"a/*comment\", \"line\", \"more_comment*/b\"]\nOutput: [\"ab\"]\nExplanation: The original source string is \"a/*comment\\nline\\nmore_comment*/b\", where we have bolded the newline characters.  After deletion, the implicit newline characters are deleted, leaving the string \"ab\", which when delimited by newline characters becomes [\"ab\"].\n\n\n \nConstraints:\n\n\n\t1 <= source.length <= 100\n\t0 <= source[i].length <= 80\n\tsource[i] consists of printable ASCII characters.\n\tEvery open block comment is eventually closed.\n\tThere are no single-quote or double-quote in the input.\n\n"

When an expression of a variable name is evaluated, within the context of that evaluation, the innermost scope (in terms of parentheses) is checked first for the value of that variable, and then outer scopes are checked sequentially. It is guaranteed that every expression is legal. Please see the examples for more details on the scope.\n\n\n \nExample 1:\n\nInput: expression = \"(let x 2 (mult x (let x 3 y 4 (add x y))))\"\nOutput: 14\nExplanation: In the expression (add x y), when checking for the value of the variable x,\nwe check from the innermost scope to the outermost in the context of the variable we are trying to evaluate.\nSince x = 3 is found first, the value of x is 3.\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: expression = \"(let x 3 x 2 x)\"\nOutput: 2\nExplanation: Assignment in let statements is processed sequentially.\n\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput: expression = \"(let x 1 y 2 x (add x y) (add x y))\"\nOutput: 5\nExplanation: The first (add x y) evaluates as 3, and is assigned to x.\nThe second (add x y) evaluates as 3+2 = 5.\n\n\n \nConstraints:\n\n\n\t1 <= expression.length <= 2000\n\tThere are no leading or trailing spaces in expression.\n\tAll tokens are separated by a single space in expression.\n\tThe answer and all intermediate calculations of that answer are guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit integer.\n\tThe expression is guaranteed to be legal and evaluate to an integer.\n\n"

If there are multiple such indices j, you can only jump to the smallest such index j.\n\tIt may be the case that for some index i, there are no legal jumps.\n\n\nA starting index is good if, starting from that index, you can reach the end of the array (index arr.length - 1) by jumping some number of times (possibly 0 or more than once).\n\nReturn the number of good starting indices.\n\n \nExample 1:\n\nInput: arr = [10,13,12,14,15]\nOutput: 2\nExplanation: \nFrom starting index i = 0, we can make our 1st jump to i = 2 (since arr[2] is the smallest among arr[1], arr[2], arr[3], arr[4] that is greater or equal to arr[0]), then we cannot jump any more.\nFrom starting index i = 1 and i = 2, we can make our 1st jump to i = 3, then we cannot jump any more.\nFrom starting index i = 3, we can make our 1st jump to i = 4, so we have reached the end.\nFrom starting index i = 4, we have reached the end already.\nIn total, there are 2 different starting indices i = 3 and i = 4, where we can reach the end with some number of\njumps.\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: arr = [2,3,1,1,4]\nOutput: 3\nExplanation: \nFrom starting index i = 0, we make jumps to i = 1, i = 2, i = 3:\nDuring our 1st jump (odd-numbered), we first jump to i = 1 because arr[1] is the smallest value in [arr[1], arr[2], arr[3], arr[4]] that is greater than or equal to arr[0].\nDuring our 2nd jump (even-numbered), we jump from i = 1 to i = 2 because arr[2] is the largest value in [arr[2], arr[3], arr[4]] that is less than or equal to arr[1]. arr[3] is also the largest value, but 2 is a smaller index, so we can only jump to i = 2 and not i = 3\nDuring our 3rd jump (odd-numbered), we jump from i = 2 to i = 3 because arr[3] is the smallest value in [arr[3], arr[4]] that is greater than or equal to arr[2].\nWe can't jump from i = 3 to i = 4, so the starting index i = 0 is not good.\nIn a similar manner, we can deduce that:\nFrom starting index i = 1, we jump to i = 4, so we reach the end.\nFrom starting index i = 2, we jump to i = 3, and then we can't jump anymore.\nFrom starting index i = 3, we jump to i = 4, so we reach the end.\nFrom starting index i = 4, we are already at the end.\nIn total, there are 3 different starting indices i = 1, i = 3, and i = 4, where we can reach the end with some\nnumber of jumps.\n\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput: arr = [5,1,3,4,2]\nOutput: 3\nExplanation: We can reach the end from starting indices 1, 2, and 4.\n\n\n \nConstraints:\n\n\n\t1 <= arr.length <= 2 * 104\n\t0 <= arr[i] < 105\n\n"

    "description": "Design a Skiplist without using any built-in libraries.\n\nA skiplist is a data structure that takes O(log(n)) time to add, erase and search. Comparing with treap and red-black tree which has the same function and performance, the code length of Skiplist can be comparatively short and the idea behind Skiplists is just simple linked lists.\n\nFor example, we have a Skiplist containing [30,40,50,60,70,90] and we want to add 80 and 45 into it. The Skiplist works this way:\n\n\nArtyom Kalinin [CC BY-SA 3.0], via Wikimedia Commons\n\nYou can see there are many layers in the Skiplist. Each layer is a sorted linked list. With the help of the top layers, add, erase and search can be faster than O(n). It can be proven that the average time complexity for each operation is O(log(n)) and space complexity is O(n).\n\nSee more about Skiplist: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skip_list\n\nImplement the Skiplist class:\n\n\n\tSkiplist() Initializes the object of the skiplist.\n\tbool search(int target) Returns true if the integer target exists in the Skiplist or false otherwise.\n\tvoid add(int num) Inserts the value num into the SkipList.\n\tbool erase(int num) Removes the value num from the Skiplist and returns true. If num does not exist in the Skiplist, do nothing and return false. If there exist multiple num values, removing any one of them is fine.\n\n\nNote that duplicates may exist in the Skiplist, your code needs to handle this situation.\n\n \nExample 1:\n\nInput\n[\"Skiplist\", \"add\", \"add\", \"add\", \"search\", \"add\", \"search\", \"erase\", \"erase\", \"search\"]\n[[], [1], [2], [3], [0], [4], [1], [0], [1], [1]]\nOutput\n[null, null, null, null, false, null, true, false, true, false]\n\nExplanation\nSkiplist skiplist = new Skiplist();\nskiplist.add(1);\nskiplist.add(2);\nskiplist.add(3);\nskiplist.search(0); // return False\nskiplist.add(4);\nskiplist.search(1); // return True\nskiplist.erase(0);  // return False, 0 is not in skiplist.\nskiplist.erase(1);  // return True\nskiplist.search(1); // return False, 1 has already been erased.\n\n \nConstraints:\n\n\n\t0 <= num, target <= 2 * 104\n\tAt most 5 * 104 calls will be made to search, add, and erase.\n\n"

The function may be called for the same philosopher more than once, even before the last call ends.\n\n \nExample 1:\n\nInput: n = 1\nOutput: [[4,2,1],[4,1,1],[0,1,1],[2,2,1],[2,1,1],[2,0,3],[2,1,2],[2,2,2],[4,0,3],[4,1,2],[0,2,1],[4,2,2],[3,2,1],[3,1,1],[0,0,3],[0,1,2],[0,2,2],[1,2,1],[1,1,1],[3,0,3],[3,1,2],[3,2,2],[1,0,3],[1,1,2],[1,2,2]]\nExplanation:\nn is the number of times each philosopher will call the function.\nThe output array describes the calls you made to the functions controlling the forks and the eat function, its format is:\noutput[i] = [a, b, c] (three integers)\n- a is the id of a philosopher.\n- b specifies the fork: {1 : left, 2 : right}.\n- c specifies the operation: {1 : pick, 2 : put, 3 : eat}.\n\n \nConstraints:\n\n\n\t1 <= n <= 60\n\n"

    "description": "Given an undirected tree consisting of n vertices numbered from 1 to n. A frog starts jumping from vertex 1. In one second, the frog jumps from its current vertex to another unvisited vertex if they are directly connected. The frog can not jump back to a visited vertex. In case the frog can jump to several vertices, it jumps randomly to one of them with the same probability. Otherwise, when the frog can not jump to any unvisited vertex, it jumps forever on the same vertex.\n\nThe edges of the undirected tree are given in the array edges, where edges[i] = [ai, bi] means that exists an edge connecting the vertices ai and bi.\n\nReturn the probability that after t seconds the frog is on the vertex target. Answers within 10-5 of the actual answer will be accepted.\n\n \nExample 1:\n\nInput: n = 7, edges = [[1,2],[1,3],[1,7],[2,4],[2,6],[3,5]], t = 2, target = 4\nOutput: 0.16666666666666666 \nExplanation: The figure above shows the given graph. The frog starts at vertex 1, jumping with 1/3 probability to the vertex 2 after second 1 and then jumping with 1/2 probability to vertex 4 after second 2. Thus the probability for the frog is on the vertex 4 after 2 seconds is 1/3 * 1/2 = 1/6 = 0.16666666666666666. \n\n\nExample 2:\n\n\nInput: n = 7, edges = [[1,2],[1,3],[1,7],[2,4],[2,6],[3,5]], t = 1, target = 7\nOutput: 0.3333333333333333\nExplanation: The figure above shows the given graph.

A minimum spanning tree (MST) is a subset of the graph's edges that connects all vertices without cycles and with the minimum possible total edge weight.\n\nFind all the critical and pseudo-critical edges in the given graph's minimum spanning tree (MST). An MST edge whose deletion from the graph would cause the MST weight to increase is called a critical edge. On the other hand, a pseudo-critical edge is that which can appear in some MSTs but not all.\n\nNote that you can return the indices of the edges in any order.\n\n \nExample 1:\n\n\n\nInput: n = 5, edges = [[0,1,1],[1,2,1],[2,3,2],[0,3,2],[0,4,3],[3,4,3],[1,4,6]]\nOutput: [[0,1],[2,3,4,5]]\nExplanation: The figure above describes the graph.\nThe following figure shows all the possible MSTs:\n\nNotice that the two edges 0 and 1 appear in all MSTs, therefore they are critical edges, so we return them in the first list of the output.\nThe edges 2, 3, 4, and 5 are only part of some MSTs, therefore they are considered pseudo-critical edges.

Let's define the recursive function Successor(x, curOrder), which given a person x and the inheritance order so far, returns who should be the next person after x in the order of inheritance.\n\nSuccessor(x, curOrder):\n    if x has no children or all of x's children are in curOrder:\n        if x is the king return null\n        else return Successor(x's parent, curOrder)\n    else return x's oldest child who's not in curOrder\n\n\nFor example, assume we have a kingdom that consists of the king, his children Alice and Bob (Alice is older than Bob), and finally Alice's son Jack.\n\n\n\tIn the beginning, curOrder will be [\"king\"].\n\tCalling Successor(king, curOrder) will return Alice, so we append to curOrder to get [\"king\", \"Alice\"].\n\tCalling Successor(Alice, curOrder) will return Jack, so we append to curOrder to get [\"king\", \"Alice\", \"Jack\"].\n\tCalling Successor(Jack, curOrder) will return Bob, so we append to curOrder to get [\"king\", \"Alice\", \"Jack\", \"Bob\"].\n\tCalling Successor(Bob, curOrder) will return null. Thus the order of inheritance will be [\"king\", \"Alice\", \"Jack\", \"Bob\"].\n\n\nUsing the above function, we can always obtain a unique order of inheritance.\n\nImplement the ThroneInheritance class:\n\n\n\tThroneInheritance(string kingName) Initializes an object of the ThroneInheritance class. The name of the king is given as part of the constructor.\n\tvoid birth(string parentName, string childName) Indicates that parentName gave birth to childName.\n\tvoid death(string name) Indicates the death of name. The death of the person doesn't affect the Successor function nor the current inheritance order.

The ship will follow these steps:\n\n\n\tThe ship will take some number of boxes from the boxes queue, not violating the maxBoxes and maxWeight constraints.\n\tFor each loaded box in order, the ship will make a trip to the port the box needs to be delivered to and deliver it.

There are no buy orders with prices larger than or equal to 15, so the 2 orders are added to the backlog.\n- 1 order of type sell with price 25 is placed. There are no buy orders with prices larger than or equal to 25 in the backlog, so this order is added to the backlog.\n- 4 orders of type buy with price 30 are placed.

There are no buy orders, so the 109 orders are added to the backlog.\n- 3 orders of type buy with price 15 are placed. They are matched with the 3 sell orders with the least price which is 7, and those 3 sell orders are removed from the backlog.\n- 999999995 orders of type buy with price 5 are placed.

You are given an integer array stones, where stones[i] is the value of the ith stone.\n\nAlice and Bob take turns, with Alice starting first. On each turn, the player may remove any stone from stones. The player who removes a stone loses if the sum of the values of all removed stones is divisible by 3.

Bob waters the plants in order from right to left, starting from the (n - 1)th plant. They begin watering the plants simultaneously.\n\tIt takes the same amount of time to water each plant regardless of how much water it needs.\n\tAlice/Bob must water the plant if they have enough in their can to fully water it. Otherwise, they first refill their can (instantaneously) then water the plant.\n\tIn case both Alice and Bob reach the same plant, the one with more water currently in his/her watering can should water this plant.

However, she remembers the integers that were present in the arrays lower and higher, but not the array each integer belonged to. Help Alice and recover the original array.\n\nGiven an array nums consisting of 2n integers, where exactly n of the integers were present in lower and the remaining in higher, return the original array arr. In case the answer is not unique, return any valid array.\n\nNote: The test cases are generated such that there exists at least one valid array arr.\n\n \nExample 1:\n\nInput: nums = [2,10,6,4,8,12]\nOutput: [3,7,11]\nExplanation:\nIf arr = [3,7,11] and k = 1, we get lower = [2,6,10] and higher = [4,8,12].\nCombining lower and higher gives us [2,6,10,4,8,12], which is a permutation of nums.\nAnother valid possibility is that arr = [5,7,9] and k = 3. In that case, lower = [2,4,6] and higher = [8,10,12]. \n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: nums = [1,1,3,3]\nOutput: [2,2]\nExplanation:\nIf arr = [2,2] and k = 1, we get lower = [1,1] and higher = [3,3].\nCombining lower and higher gives us [1,1,3,3], which is equal to nums.\nNote that arr cannot be [1,3] because in that case, the only possible way to obtain [1,1,3,3] is with k = 0.\nThis is invalid since k must be positive.\n\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput: nums = [5,435]\nOutput: [220]\nExplanation:\nThe only possible combination is arr = [220] and k = 215.

The microwave normalizes what you push as four digits by prepending zeroes. It interprets the first two digits as the minutes and the last two digits as the seconds. It then adds them up as the cooking time. For example,\n\n\n\tYou push 9 5 4 (three digits). It is normalized as 0954 and interpreted as 9 minutes and 54 seconds.\n\tYou push 0 0 0 8 (four digits). It is interpreted as 0 minutes and 8 seconds.\n\tYou push 8 0 9 0. It is interpreted as 80 minutes and 90 seconds.\n\tYou push 8 1 3 0.

Similarly, to add the letter 'k', Alice has to press '5' twice.\n\tNote that the digits '0' and '1' do not map to any letters, so Alice does not use them.\n\n\nHowever, due to an error in transmission, Bob did not receive Alice's text message but received a string of pressed keys instead.\n\n\n\tFor example, when Alice sent the message \"bob\", Bob received the string \"2266622\".\n\n\nGiven a string pressedKeys representing the string received by Bob, return the total number of possible text messages Alice could have sent.\n\nSince the answer may be very large, return it modulo 109 + 7.\n\n \nExample 1:\n\nInput: pressedKeys = \"22233\"\nOutput: 8\nExplanation:\nThe possible text messages Alice could have sent are:\n\"aaadd\", \"abdd\", \"badd\", \"cdd\", \"aaae\", \"abe\", \"bae\", and \"ce\".\nSince there are 8 possible messages, we return 8.\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: pressedKeys = \"222222222222222222222222222222222222\"\nOutput: 82876089\nExplanation:\nThere are 2082876103 possible text messages Alice could have sent.\nSince we need to return the answer modulo 109 + 7, we return 2082876103 % (109 + 7) = 82876089.\n\n\n \nConstraints:\n\n\n\t1 <= pressedKeys.length <= 105\n\tpressedKeys only consists of digits from '2' - '9'.\n\n"

You are given a 2D integer array edges of length n - 1 where edges[i] = [ai, bi] indicates that there is an edge between nodes ai and bi in the tree.\n\nAt every node i, there is a gate. You are also given an array of even integers amount, where amount[i] represents:\n\n\n\tthe price needed to open the gate at node i, if amount[i] is negative, or,\n\tthe cash reward obtained on opening the gate at node i, otherwise.\n\n\nThe game goes on as follows:\n\n\n\tInitially, Alice is at node 0 and Bob is at node bob.\n\tAt every second, Alice and Bob each move to an adjacent node. Alice moves towards some leaf node, while Bob moves towards node 0.\n\tFor every node along their path, Alice and Bob either spend money to open the gate at that node, or accept the reward. Note that:\n\t\n\t\tIf the gate is already open, no price will be required, nor will there be any cash reward.\n\t\tIf Alice and Bob reach the node simultaneously, they share the price/reward for opening the gate there. In other words, if the price to open the gate is c, then both Alice and Bob pay c / 2 each.

The game goes as follows:\n- Alice is initially on node 0, Bob on node 3. They open the gates of their respective nodes.\n  Alice's net income is now -2.\n- Both Alice and Bob move to node 1. \n  Since they reach here simultaneously, they open the gate together and share the reward.\n  Alice's net income becomes -2 + (4 / 2) = 0.\n- Alice moves on to node 3. Since Bob already opened its gate, Alice's income remains unchanged.\n  Bob moves on to node 0, and stops moving.\n- Alice moves on to node 4 and opens the gate there. Her net income becomes 0 + 6 = 6.\nNow, neither Alice nor Bob can make any further moves, and the game ends.\nIt is not possible for Alice to get a higher net income.\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: edges = [[0,1]], bob = 1, amount = [-7280,2350]\nOutput: -7280\nExplanation: \nAlice follows the path 0->1 whereas Bob follows the path 1->0.\nThus, Alice opens the gate at node 0 only.

Representing a 0-indexed array arr of length n where all positions are set to 0's, except position p which is set to 1.\n\nYou are also given an integer array banned containing some positions from the array. For the ith position in banned, arr[banned[i]] = 0, and banned[i] != p.\n\nYou can perform multiple operations on arr. In an operation, you can choose a subarray with size k and reverse the subarray. However, the 1 in arr should never go to any of the positions in banned. In other words, after each operation arr[banned[i]] remains 0.\n\nReturn an array ans where for each i from [0, n - 1], ans[i] is the minimum number of reverse operations needed to bring the 1 to position i in arr, or -1 if it is impossible.\n\n\n\tA subarray is a contiguous non-empty sequence of elements within an array.\n\tThe values of ans[i] are independent for all i's.\n\tThe reverse of an array is an array containing the values in reverse order.\n\n\n \nExample 1:\n\nInput: n = 4, p = 0, banned = [1,2], k = 4\nOutput: [0,-1,-1,1]\nExplanation: In this case k = 4 so there is only one possible reverse operation we can perform, which is reversing the whole array. Initially, 1 is placed at position 0 so the amount of operations we need for position 0 is 0. We can never place a 1 on the banned positions, so the answer for positions 1 and 2 is -1.

We can perform reverse operations of size 3. The 1 is currently located at position 0, so we need to reverse the subarray [0, 2] for it to leave that position, but reversing that subarray makes position 2 have a 1, which shouldn't happen. So, we can't move the 1 from position 0, making the result for all the other positions -1. \n\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput: n = 4, p = 2, banned = [0,1,3], k = 1\nOutput: [-1,-1,0,-1]\nExplanation: In this case we can only perform reverse operations of size 1. So the 1 never changes its position.\n\n\n \nConstraints:\n\n\n\t1 <= n <= 105\n\t0 <= p <= n - 1\n\t0 <= banned.length <= n - 1\n\t0 <= banned[i] <= n - 1\n\t1 <= k <= n \n\tbanned[i] != p\n\tall values in banned are unique \n\n"

    "description": "Write code that enhances all arrays such that you can call the snail(rowsCount, colsCount) method that transforms the 1D array into a 2D array organised in the pattern known as snail traversal order. Invalid input values should output an empty array. If rowsCount * colsCount !== nums.length, the input is considered invalid.\n\nSnail traversal order starts at the top left cell with the first value of the current array. It then moves through the entire first column from top to bottom, followed by moving to the next column on the right and traversing it from bottom to top. This pattern continues, alternating the direction of traversal with each column, until the entire current array is covered. For example, when given the input array [19, 10, 3, 7, 9, 8, 5, 2, 1, 17, 16, 14, 12, 18, 6, 13, 11, 20, 4, 15] with rowsCount = 5 and colsCount = 4, the desired output matrix is shown below. Note that iterating the matrix following the arrows corresponds to the order of numbers in the original array.\n\n \n\n\n\n \nExample 1:\n\nInput: \nnums = [19, 10, 3, 7, 9, 8, 5, 2, 1, 17, 16, 14, 12, 18, 6, 13, 11, 20, 4, 15]\nrowsCount = 5\ncolsCount = 4\nOutput: \n[\n [19,17,16,15],\n [10,1,14,4],\n [3,2,12,20],\n [7,5,18,11],\n [9,8,6,13]\n]\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: \nnums = [1,2,3,4]\nrowsCount = 1\ncolsCount = 4\nOutput: [[1, 2, 3, 4]]\n\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput: \nnums = [1,3]\nrowsCount = 2\ncolsCount = 2\nOutput: []\nExplanation: 2 multiplied by 2 is 4, and the original array [1,3] has a length of 2; therefore, the input is invalid.\n\n\n \nConstraints:\n\n\n\t0 <= nums.length <= 250\n\t1 <= nums[i] <= 1000\n\t1 <= rowsCount <= 250\n\t1 <= colsCount <= 250\n\n\n \n"

    "description": "Given a multi-dimensional array arr and a depth n, return a flattened version of that array.\n\nA multi-dimensional array is a recursive data structure that contains integers or other multi-dimensional arrays.\n\nA flattened array is a version of that array with some or all of the sub-arrays removed and replaced with the actual elements in that sub-array. This flattening operation should only be done if the current depth of nesting is less than n. The depth of the elements in the first array are considered to be 0.\n\nPlease solve it without the built-in Array.flat method.\n\n \nExample 1:\n\nInput\narr = [1, 2, 3, [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, [9, 10, 11], 12], [13, 14, 15]]\nn = 0\nOutput\n[1, 2, 3, [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, [9, 10, 11], 12], [13, 14, 15]]\n\nExplanation\nPassing a depth of n=0 will always result in the original array. This is because the smallest possible depth of a subarray (0) is not less than n=0. Thus, no subarray should be flattened. \n\nExample 2:\n\nInput\narr = [1, 2, 3, [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, [9, 10, 11], 12], [13, 14, 15]]\nn = 1\nOutput\n[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, [9, 10, 11], 12, 13, 14, 15]\n\nExplanation\nThe subarrays starting with 4, 7, and 13 are all flattened.

    "description": "Sometimes you have a long running task, and you may wish to cancel it before it completes. To help with this goal, write a function cancellable that accepts a generator object and returns an array of two values: a cancel function and a promise.\n\nYou may assume the generator function will only yield promises. It is your function's responsibility to pass the values resolved by the promise back to the generator. If the promise rejects, your function should throw that error back to the generator.\n\nIf the cancel callback is called before the generator is done, your function should throw an error back to the generator. That error should be the string \"Cancelled\" (Not an Error object). If the error was caught, the returned promise should resolve with the next value that was yielded or returned. Otherwise, the promise should reject with the thrown error. No more code should be executed.\n\nWhen the generator is done, the promise your function returned should resolve the value the generator returned. If, however, the generator throws an error, the returned promise should reject with the error.\n\nAn example of how your code would be used:\n\nfunction* tasks() {\n  const val = yield new Promise(resolve => resolve(2 + 2));\n  yield new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 100));\n  return val + 1; // calculation shouldn't be done.\n}\nconst [cancel, promise] = cancellable(tasks());\nsetTimeout(cancel, 50);\npromise.catch(console.log); // logs \"Cancelled\" at t=50ms\n\n\nIf instead cancel() was not called or was called after t=100ms, the promise would have resolved 5.\n\n \nExample 1:\n\nInput: \ngeneratorFunction = function*() { \n  return 42; \n}\ncancelledAt = 100\nOutput: {\"resolved\": 42}\nExplanation:\nconst generator = generatorFunction();\nconst [cancel, promise] = cancellable(generator);\nsetTimeout(cancel, 100);\npromise.then(console.log); // resolves 42 at t=0ms\n\nThe generator immediately yields 42 and finishes. Because of that, the returned promise immediately resolves 42. Note that cancelling a finished generator does nothing.\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput:\ngeneratorFunction = function*() { \n  const msg = yield new Promise(res => res(\"Hello\")); \n  throw `Error: ${msg}`; \n}\ncancelledAt = null\nOutput: {\"rejected\": \"Error: Hello\"}\nExplanation:\nA promise is yielded. The function handles this by waiting for it to resolve and then passes the resolved value back to the generator. Then an error is thrown which has the effect of causing the promise to reject with the same thrown error.\n\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput: \ngeneratorFunction = function*() { \n  yield new Promise(res => setTimeout(res, 200)); \n  return \"Success\"; \n}\ncancelledAt = 100\nOutput: {\"rejected\": \"Cancelled\"}\nExplanation:\nWhile the function is waiting for the yielded promise to resolve, cancel() is called. This causes an error message to be sent back to the generator. Since this error is uncaught, the returned promise rejected with this error.\n\n\nExample 4:\n\nInput:\ngeneratorFunction = function*() { \n  let result = 0; \n  yield new Promise(res => setTimeout(res, 100));\n  result += yield new Promise(res => res(1)); \n  yield new Promise(res => setTimeout(res, 100)); \n  result += yield new Promise(res => res(1)); \n  return result;\n}\ncancelledAt = null\nOutput: {\"resolved\": 2}\nExplanation:\n4 promises are yielded. Two of those promises have their values added to the result. After 200ms, the generator finishes with a value of 2, and that value is resolved by the returned promise.\n\n\nExample 5:\n\nInput: \ngeneratorFunction = function*() { \n  let result = 0; \n  try { \n    yield new Promise(res => setTimeout(res, 100)); \n    result += yield new Promise(res => res(1)); \n    yield new Promise(res => setTimeout(res, 100)); \n    result += yield new Promise(res => res(1)); \n  } catch(e) { \n    return result; \n  } \n  return result; \n}\ncancelledAt = 150\nOutput: {\"resolved\": 1}\nExplanation:\nThe first two yielded promises resolve and cause the result to increment. However, at t=150ms, the generator is cancelled. The error sent to the generator is caught and the result is returned and finally resolved by the returned promise.\n\n\nExample 6:\n\nInput: \ngeneratorFunction = function*() { \n  try { \n    yield new Promise((resolve, reject) => reject(\"Promise Rejected\")); \n  } catch(e) { \n    let a = yield new Promise(resolve => resolve(2));\n    let b = yield new Promise(resolve => resolve(2)); \n    return a + b; \n  }; \n}\ncancelledAt = null\nOutput: {\"resolved\": 4}\nExplanation:\nThe first yielded promise immediately rejects. This error is caught. Because the generator hasn't been cancelled, execution continues as usual. It ends up resolving 2 + 2 = 4.\n\n \nConstraints:\n\n\n\tcancelledAt == null or 0 <= cancelledAt <= 1000\n\tgeneratorFunction returns a generator object\n\n"

All integers in positions are unique.\n\nAll robots start moving on the line simultaneously at the same speed in their given directions. If two robots ever share the same position while moving, they will collide.\n\nIf two robots collide, the robot with lower health is removed from the line, and the health of the other robot decreases by one. The surviving robot continues in the same direction it was going. If both robots have the same health, they are both removed from the line.\n\nYour task is to determine the health of the robots that survive the collisions, in the same order that the robots were given, i.e. final heath of robot 1 (if survived), final health of robot 2 (if survived), and so on.

Firstly, robot 1 and robot 2 will collide, and since both have the same health, they will be removed from the line. Next, robot 3 and robot 4 will collide and since robot 4's health is smaller, it gets removed, and robot 3's health becomes 15 - 1 = 14.

An infected child at position i can spread the disease to either of its immediate neighboring children at positions i - 1 and i + 1 if they exist and are currently not infected. At most one child who was previously not infected can get infected with the disease in one second.\n\nIt can be shown that after a finite number of seconds, all the children in the queue will get infected with the disease.
